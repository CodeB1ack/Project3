This is a simple to do list structured using react. It also features a form to submit your email and any comments the user may have.

As a user I would like to make a simple list so that i can keep up with chores

As a user I would like to easily rearrange task in my list so that I can switch order of importance

As a user I would like a sign up form so that I can leave my email and name for registration and possible news updates

To use the list you just type in any thing that you need to do or get in a list format.

I used html, css, javascript, React

For the future I would like make it look much better and have a sign in function.
